# Infix-to-Postfix-Evaluation
     You are to implement a program that converts an infix expression into a postfix
     expression and then evaluate the postfix expression.  You are to use the Stack and Queue
     classes you developed with your last assignment where Stack and Queue use your Array class
     to manage the data in the stack and the queue.
     Output: Print out the infix expression, the postfix expression and the calculated results of
     the expression. You are to handle the (), + - * / and  ^(exponential/power) operators. The
     ^ operator precedence is higher than * and / operators. Turn in to me the program and the
     resulting output. Put the input data into a file to be read in. Test your program with some
     simple expressions before using the data below and make sure each of your operations work
     correctly.
